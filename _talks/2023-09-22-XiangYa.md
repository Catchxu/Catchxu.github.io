We introduced multimodal machine learning technologies for multi-omics data, and discussed how to discover rare diseases with deep learning methods.

In this talk, we discussed how spatial transcriptomics, as a unique data type containing both gene expression and tissue images, offers new possibilities for multimodal joint learning. We used recent works from our team, including [STANDS](/portfolios/portfolio-4/), as examples to illustrate how data-driven or theory-driven multimodal learning methods can be applied to some specific tasks, including but not limited to discovering anomalous tissue regions, integrating batch effects, and exploring gene co-expression.
