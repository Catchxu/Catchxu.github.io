We discussed how to detect anomalous samples in multi-omics data with generative models and introduced our team's work, ACSleuth and STANDS.

In this talk, we presented the two recent works, [ACSleuth](/portfolios/portfolio-3/) and [STANDS](/portfolios/portfolio-4/), proposed by our team, and their applicable tasks, implementation principles, and limitations. Among them, ACSleuth is more suitable for anomalous cell detection in single-cell omics, and the specially designed MMD-based anomaly scorer enhances the algorithm's tolerance to batch effects. On the other hand, STANDS, as a multitask framework, is better suited for spatial transcriptomics, and it can integrate gene expression with tissue imaging to accomplish various multimodal tasks.
