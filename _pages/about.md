Greetings, welcome to my page!

I am Kaichen Xu, currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in Statistics at [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law (ZUEL)](https://english.zuel.edu.cn/), where I am very fortunate to work under the mentorship of [Prof. Xiaobo Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l56IWfgAAAAJ&hl=en) from the School of Statistics and Mathematics, ZUEL, and [Prof. Hao Wu](https://www.haowulab.org/) from the faculty of Computer Science and Control Engineering, Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology. 

My research interests include but are not limited to generative model; computational biology and bioinformatics; theory of computation and deep learning. My collaborators and I have developed numerous algorithms and tools based on generative models for disease discovery, batch effect correction, data retrieval, and other applications. Moreover, beyond AI+biology scenarios, I have been working on generalizing these methods to broader scenarios, making sustained contributions to the computer science community through theoretical analysis and empirical validation. See [Publications](./publications.md) pages for detail.

Additionally, I am also applying for PhD programs related to Computer Science, Data Science or Statistics. More information about myself has been provided at [CV](./cv.html). If you are interested in my research experience and would like to explore potential collaboration, please feel free to send me an email at kaichenxu358@gmail.com, and I am more than happy to discuss!
